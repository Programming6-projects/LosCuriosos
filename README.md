## Description

As a customer, I have a beverage distribution company (Pepsi, Pepsi Black,
Guarana, Pacenia, Chicha, Huari) all these drinks are stored in a warehouse and
I need a system to help me manage my business, the system must be able to
receive orders and deliver them to different destinations which may be different
cities, to deliver orders I have trucks with large weight capacity and Vans (it
is a small truck or a type of van that will handle small orders ie have little
weight capacity).

- The application needs to be a REST API.
- When starting the application, we should start with X number of delivery
  vehicles.
- The customer should be able to place an order.
- We need to be able to reject orders if we do not have vehicles available to
  make a delivery.
- A vehicle is unavailable when we no longer have vehicles available or with
  sufficient capacity to deliver an order.
- An order cannot be delivered by more than 1 vehicle.
- The customer must be notified of the status of their order.
- A truck can have a minimum capacity of 7000kg.
- There may be different types of trucks, some with more capacity than others.
- Any other type of vehicle used for deliveries with a capacity of less than
  7000kg is considered a van.
- The app must have CI
- The app must have unit tests
